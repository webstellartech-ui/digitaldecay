# Digital Decay

Digital Decay is a premium, interactive web experience that explores the aesthetics of data corruption and reconstruction. Utilizing **Three.js** and **WebGL shaders**, this project creates a real-time pixel sorting and glitch effect that responds to user interaction.

## 🌟 The Effect

The "Digital Decay" effect simulates the breakdown of digital imagery through:
*   **Interactive Healing**: The digital chaos "heals" and reconstructs into a clear image as you hover your mouse, creating a "flashlight" effect of clarity in a sea of digital noise.
*   **Pixel Sorting**: Dynamic algorithms displace pixels horizontally based on simulated noise, creating the signature "melting" data look.
*   **Chromatic Aberration**: RGB channels split and drift, mimicking signal interference.
*   **Scanline Artifacts**: Subtle CRT-monitor style scanlines overlay the image, enhancing the retro-futuristic data aesthetic.

## 🚀 How to Start

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### 1. Prerequisite
Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the application at the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### 4. Build for Production
To create an optimized build for deployment:
```bash
npm run build
```
